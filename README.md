# Zen Cart - Back in Stock Notifications
If a product is out of stock, customers can subscribe/request to receive a notification when that product becomes available again.

This is based the original CEON version, not the ajax version. Neither are supported anymore, but the functionality is well worthwhile.

I've been modifying it for years, so here is where I'll add in those modifications when the mood takes me and in the process make the code more Zen-ish to maybe get it into the core one day.

You may report bugs here (for the CEON version only).

Note that the original documention in the /_docs folder will NOT be updated.
